# Setup
1. Clone/download repo somewhere
2. Find "build.gradle" in finder, rightclick -> open with IntelliJ
3. Project should be open! Navigate to src/main/java/fizzbuzz to see the 2 files I created

At some point intellij might ask you where java or gradle are. If you followed a "normal" install, Java should be somewhere like `Program Files/java/jdk10.xxx` and Gradle should be in `C:/Gradle/gradle4.y/bin/gradle`
